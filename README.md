# ijn<br>
so app is ijn/apps/letme - it is notes manager with registering via email or yandexId<br>
It takes me over a month to code it and about a month to force it to work. I stuck when tried to add new functionality, especially frontend - code is in a some kind of mess. Another problem - frontend behavior differs on different devices. Some functions do not work on Iphone or Mozila mobile/desktop<br>
If you need - I could try to place it on VDS again, but my opinion: according CleanArchitecure I need totally rewrite backend and I think it is a good idea to use VueJS for frontend to limit number of lines. So... If you be scared - I it is ok :-)))<br>
<br>
entrance to app is here: ijn/apps/letme/index.php<br>
<br>
all backend php-code is here: ijn/apps/letme/protected<br>
cron-jobs/apache/certbot/other_external_config is here: ijn/apps/letme/protected/IMPORTANT/IMPORTANT.txt<br>
<br>
all frontend code is here: /ijn/apps/letme/public<br>
<br>
ijn/protected - frameworks to register via email as I remember
